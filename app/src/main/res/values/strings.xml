        the world’s largest producer and exporter, offloading the majority of its output
        to more than 150 countries worldwide.The Gulf states account for 11% of the $600BN global petrochemical industry.
        Over the next five years, the Gulf’s market share of the global petrochemical industry will jump to over 17%,

        Gulf states are poised to become the world’s largest source of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP).
        The PE production capacities in the GCC countries are expected to increase from 10.7 million tonnes in 2009
        to 21.5 million tonnes by 2015, while the production of PP is expected to rise from 4.8 million tonnes in 2009
        to 9.5 million tonnes by 2015. This will bring the combined production capacities of the two major polyolefin resins to
        over 31 million tonnes by 2015. By 2020, GCC plastic consumption will grow about 8%,compared to 25 % by Europe and NAFTA countries,
        and 37 % in Asian and Oceanic countries. The world will consume 540 million tonnes of plastic in 2020,
        The plastic sector also benefiting strongly from Gulf Countries drive towards “green buildings” in the recent years.
        There is continuous growth in the plastics converting industry with substantial expansion of polymer production in the Middle East.
        This makes the region a major market for plastic additives. The UAE’s massive drive to build one of the world’s most advanced
        infrastructures has fuelled demand for plastics products, from tubes to cables and wires. The automotive industry benefits
        from the use of plastic tubes because the material makes cars lighter; so do hospitals are shifting from breakable glass syringes
        to plastic ones.
